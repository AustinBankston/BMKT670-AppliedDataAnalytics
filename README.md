# applied-data-analytics

This is the main repository for Applied Data Analytics. I'll add code to this as the semester proceeds. It's best practice to do regular pulls, particularly on Friday (so you can look at things over the weekend) and before class. 

When you do a fresh pull for the upcoming week you'll typically see a new folder containing code and sometimes data. You should make sure you can execute any code that doesn't contain a word like "solutions" in the file name. You may want to create your own version of the code, perhaps by appending your initials to the file name. If you don't do this, you'll run into errors trying to do fresh pulls when I update a file you're working on. The error message will say `Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: [filename]`. If your working copy has a different name, this won't happen.
